Redux-toolkit (mutation);

    In RTK Query (Redux Toolkit's data-fetching library):
    A mutation is used for making write operations — such as POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE — that change data on the server.

    QUERY-we use provideTags to access data from the cache 
    MUTATION-we use invalidateTags to access the data from the backend 

    >>npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

MULTER- used to upload files like images ,videos (basically converts the file we send to binary and send them on the server)
